# TODO
- Figure out how to handle per voxel color (nointerpolation in shader trick
- Re-implement AO calculations (but based on a larger scale / blurred voxel repr.)
- Re-implement props with hopefully better implementation
- Research into ways to render procedural indexed indirect meshes using Shader Graph (without making them non-indexed)
  - This would allow us to generate meshes on the GPU and render them directly (and use the height map approximation as well)
- Biome generation (custom data readback)
- Custom graph buffer initialization and readback (material, color, smoothness / metallic, custom user data)
- Figure out ``CachedVar`` node stuff
- Fix ``Compile()`` errors ughhh
- Implement some sort of ``Diff`` node that create intermediate texture of size ``n+1``, and calculates finite diffs. from it.
- Figure out how to get Async Compute Queue working
- Implement smart range checking using texture value summation (cached textures)
- Tick based instead of frame based (WIP)
