# TODO
- Figure out how to handle per voxel color (nointerpolation in shader trick)
- Re-implement AO calculations (but based on a larger scale / blurred voxel repr.)
- Re-implement props with hopefully better implementation
  - Currently WIP, got prop readback working, but need to clean up that mess graph wise
- Wait until Shader Graph supports indirect indexed rendering
  - This would allow us to generate meshes on the GPU and render them directly
- Biome generation (custom data readback?)
- Custom graph buffer initialization and readback (material, color, smoothness / metallic, custom user data)
  - Works for props, but I don't know if I should extend it to make it work with custom user input
- Figure out ``CachedVar`` node stuff
- Implement some sort of ``Diff`` node that create intermediate texture of size ``n+1``, and calculates finite diffs. from it.
- Figure out how to get Async Compute Queue working
- Implement smart range checking using texture value summation (cached textures)
- Go octal mode and add inter chunk dependency unfortunately (will be good though since we can read a LOT more data back from the gpu)
